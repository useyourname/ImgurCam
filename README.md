This app allows you to instantly upload screenshots upon taking the screenshot to Imgur as long as you don't swipe the app away from the recent apps list (battery usage is negligible). Also, upon opening the app, you can take a picture which will be uploaded to Imgur. All uploads will give you a link which is automatically copied to your clipboard, so you can paste it anywhere you like.
